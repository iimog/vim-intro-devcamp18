# Introduction to Vim
This introduction to Vim was presented at the [Developer Camp 2018 in Würzburg](https://developercamp.io).
You can see the very minimalistic slides in the slides folder (in German).
Just open the index.html in your webbrowser.
However, this was a life demo so the slides alone might not be very useful.
All examples used [Faust - Der Tragödie Erster Teil by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe](https://github.com/GITenberg/Faust--Der-Trag-die-erster-Teil_2229).
